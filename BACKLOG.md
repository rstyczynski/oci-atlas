# OCI Atlas - Global Directory

Global Directory is a centralized catalog system for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) metadata — region attributes (network, proxy, vault, toolchain, observability) and realm information. It stores JSON data in OCI Object Storage with schema validation, versioning by domain, and provides typed client libraries for Node.js, CLI (Bash), and Terraform to read the data.
