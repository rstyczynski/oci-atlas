# Contracting Phase - Status Report

Sprint: 1 - Foundation Data Model
Review: 2 (continuation session)

## Summary

Sprint 1 scope extended by Product Owner. Original contract (`sprint_1_contract_review_1.md`) remains fully valid — project scope, rules, responsibilities, and constraints are unchanged. This review documents the new backlog item added to Sprint 1.

## Scope Extension

Product Owner added the following item to Sprint 1:

- **GD-1-fix1**: Remove `realm` attribute from tenancies json data file

Backlog updated with GD-1-fix1, GD-2, GD-3 definitions. PLAN.md updated to include GD-1-fix1 in Sprint 1.

## Understanding Confirmed

All points from contract review 1 remain valid:
- Project scope: Yes — unchanged
- Implementation plan: Yes — Sprint 1 now covers GD-1 (done) + GD-1-fix1 (new)
- General rules: Yes — unchanged
- Git rules: Yes — unchanged
- Development rules: Yes — unchanged

## Open Questions

None. GD-1-fix1 scope is clear: remove `realm` attribute from `tenancies_v1.json` (and correspondingly from `tenancies_v1.schema.json` to keep validation consistent).
