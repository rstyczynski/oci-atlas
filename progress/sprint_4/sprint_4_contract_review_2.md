# Sprint 4 - Contracting

Status: Complete

## Summary
- Reviewed `PLAN.md` (Sprint 4 added back, Status: Progress, Mode: managed) and `BACKLOG.md` (GD-4: apply VERSIONING.md strategy; remove old versions).
- Reviewed rules: `RUPStrikesBack/AGENTS.md`, `rules/generic/GENERAL_RULES.md`, `rules/generic/PRODUCT_OWNER_GUIDE.md`, `rules/generic/GIT_RULES.md`. No tech-specific rules apply.
- Examined prior sprint artefacts in `progress/sprint_4/` (analysis, inception, design) and reset PROGRESS_BOARD to starting state.

## Understanding Confirmed
- Project scope: Yes — Global Directory with OCI metadata clients (Node, Bash, Terraform) backed by versioned JSON.
- Implementation plan: Yes — Sprint 4 in Progress, managed mode, single backlog item GD-4.
- General rules: Yes — follow FSM, phase ownership, feedback files, no PLAN edits beyond status, copy-pasteable tests, no `exit` in examples.
- Git rules: Yes — semantic commits (`type: (sprint-4) ...`), commit per phase, push after commit.
- Development rules: Yes — none beyond generic rules for this stack.

## Responsibilities Enumerated
- Operate in managed mode; ask before major choices or unclear items.
- Edit only Sprint 4 phase documents; PROGRESS_BOARD updates allowed per phase.
- Keep PLAN.md untouched except status (already aligned).
- Use semantic commit messages and push after each phase.
- Preserve status tokens owned by PO; do not alter design status lines.

## Constraints
- Do not modify BACKLOG.md or other sprints’ docs.
- No destructive git operations beyond instructed resets.
- Tests/examples must be copy-pasteable and free of `exit`.

## Communication Protocol
- Raise clarifications in `progress/sprint_4/sprint_4_openquestions.md` if needed.
- Propose scope changes in `progress/sprint_4/sprint_4_proposedchanges.md`.
- Follow phase order: contracting → inception → elaboration → construction → documentation.

## Open Questions
None.
